## üìä Visualizations & Insights

### üéØ 1. Budget vs Gross Revenue  
This scatter plot reveals a strong positive correlation between a movie's budget and its gross revenue. However, the data also shows outliers‚Äîlow-budget films that made huge profits, and high-budget films that failed to recover costs. This suggests that while budget is important, it's not the only factor influencing success.

### ‚≠ê 2. IMDb Score vs Viewer Votes  
The data shows a moderate positive relationship between IMDb rating and number of votes. Movies with higher IMDb scores typically receive more attention and engagement. However, some cult classics with high ratings received fewer votes, indicating a niche but passionate audience base.

### üé• 3. Genre Popularity Over Time  
Bar plots and count plots help visualize how certain genres have trended over the years. Action, Drama, and Comedy remain dominant, while genres like Documentary and Musical show sporadic but notable success depending on era or societal interest.

### üßë‚Äçüéì 4. Director and Star Impact  
Using group-by analysis and aggregation, we examined the influence of directors and lead stars on movie performance. Directors with consistent hits can boost a movie's chances, and some stars appear in multiple high-grossing or high-rated films‚Äîindicating their draw at the box office.

### ‚è±Ô∏è 5. Runtime vs IMDb Score  
A scatter plot between runtime and IMDb score shows no strong linear relationship. Both short and long films can be rated highly, depending on content quality and audience preference.
