## üìä Visualizations & Insights

### üí∞ Gross Revenue vs Budget
This scatter plot highlights the relationship between a movie‚Äôs budget and its gross revenue. There is a clear positive trend‚Äîmovies with higher budgets generally tend to earn more. However, there are significant outliers where low-budget films have achieved massive success, and some high-budget films have underperformed. This suggests that while investing more increases the potential for returns, success ultimately depends on multiple factors, such as content quality, timing, and audience connection.

### ‚≠ê Gross Revenue vs IMDb Score
This plot compares a film's IMDb rating with its gross revenue. While there's a slight upward trend, the correlation is weak. It shows that critical acclaim (high IMDb score) doesn't always translate to box office success. Some films with average ratings can generate huge revenue due to factors like brand/franchise value, marketing, or star power, while others with high ratings may have limited commercial reach. This visualization emphasizes the difference between popularity and quality.

### üîó Correlation Matrix for Numerical Features
This heatmap presents the correlation between different numerical attributes such as budget, gross revenue, votes, score, and runtime. Notable insights:

Gross revenue is strongly correlated with budget and number of votes, indicating that well-funded and widely watched films often perform better financially.

IMDb score correlates moderately with votes, but less so with gross, reinforcing earlier observations.

Other features like runtime have weaker correlations, suggesting a less direct influence on success.

This matrix helps pinpoint which factors are most aligned with financial and popular success.
